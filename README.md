Bike Rental Regression Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the Bike Rental Regression Project! This project is aimed at building accurate regression models to predict bike rentals based on various features. The dataset used for this project is a valuable resource for understanding rental patterns and optimizing bike rental services in urban areas.

## Versions

This project is divided into three distinct versions, each building upon the previous one to improve model accuracy and explore different aspects of the data:

### Version 1: Initial XGBoost Model

In this version, we started with an initial regression model using XGBoost, a robust and efficient algorithm for regression tasks.

### Version 2: Improved XGBoost Model with Log Transformation

To enhance our XGBoost model, we applied a log transformation to the target variable to mitigate negative predictions. This version represents an important step in improving model accuracy and stability.

### Version 3: Enhanced Data Exploration and Different Models

Version 3 dives deeper into data exploration, uncovering valuable insights about the dataset. Additionally, we experimented with various regression models beyond XGBoost to identify the most suitable one for our dataset. This version provides a comprehensive view of the project's evolution and the strategies employed to achieve accurate predictions.

## Data Exploration

Data exploration is a crucial step in understanding the dataset. It involves examining the dataset's structure, identifying missing values, and visualizing key features to gain insights.

## Data Engineering

Data preprocessing is essential to prepare the dataset for modeling. This step includes handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, normalizing features, and creating new features based on datetime indices.

## Modeling

We explored various regression models, including XGBoost, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Bagging, and Support Vector Regressors. Model selection and hyperparameter tuning were performed to optimize predictive capabilities.

## Model Evaluation

Model performance was evaluated using the Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE) metric. This metric helps us understand how well our models predict bike rentals.

## Additional Considerations

In our quest for accurate predictions, we considered feature engineering techniques, cross-validation, and model interpretability. These strategies aimed to improve model performance and robustness.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a step-by-step approach to building regression models for bike rental prediction. With each version, we iteratively improved model accuracy and explored different facets of the dataset. Accurate predictions can assist bike rental operators in optimizing their services and enhancing the user experience.
